  * **User Agent Plug-in** for assisting people in generating, validating, and managing consent receipts within their web browsers.
  * **Server component** for assisting data controllers and service providers in generating, validating, and managing consent receipts through their web servers.
  * **Consent Gateway** for acting as a trusted third party in the consent receipt process as a witness, and for providing additional services.
  * **Consent Receipt**: a documentation of information required for validating and demonstrating the validity of consent in the form of a record of information associated with the consent process.
